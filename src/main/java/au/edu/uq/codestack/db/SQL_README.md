# SQL Practice Files

This directory contains a collection of SQL files intended for practice and learning.  
Each file demonstrates different aspects of SQL, including:

- Data Definition Language (DDL) — creating and modifying tables
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) — inserting, updating, and deleting records
- Querying data with `SELECT` statements
- Using joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Exploring constraints, indexes, and relationships

These files are provided for educational and self-improvement purposes.  
You can run them in any SQL-compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to experiment and practice.
